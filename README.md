# Introduction

# Visualization choosed to Redesign:

This is a pretty good visualization where we can see colorful circles a solid black line which marks the line for the equal pay for men and women. But this is a more work for a reader to do where he has to see the color of the circle go up look for which is the job field it is talking about. The second one is that soem circle's are overlapping each other not leading to a correct analysis.


# Steps taken to Redesign the Visualization

The first step i followed was to have a Claim that i wanted for my visualization. 
# Claim: Whats the best job for women in United States

The best job for a women according to my analysis would be where they get equal pay or close to the men's pay. That could also be seen in the visualization above that i am redesigning but it was very unclear which occupation gets an equal pay. 

So to start with the first thing after Data Wrangling was to upload the data in tableau, and then i created a visualization that had the salary for men and women for each occupation under each category.
