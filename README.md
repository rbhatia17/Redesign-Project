# Visualization choosed to Redesign:

This is a pretty good visualization where we can see colorful circles a solid black line which marks the line for the equal pay for men and women. But this is a more work for a reader to do where he has to see the color of the circle go up look for which is the job field it is talking about. The second one is that soem circle's are overlapping each other not leading to a correct analysis.
