#                                                   Redesign Project

# Introduction
Visualizations help you in understanding the data and making some analysis out of the given data set. The visualization i am taking to redesign is Gender Pay gap in United states.


# Visualization choosed to Redesign: 

![salary gap](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32226800/32364673-5e42fe6a-c033-11e7-8f50-4b257fd8f948.png)


This is a pretty good visualization where we can see colorful circles a solid black line which marks the line for the equal pay for men and women. But this is a more work for a reader to do where he has to see the color of the circle go up look for which is the job field it is talking about. The second one is that soem circle's are overlapping each other not leading to a correct analysis.


# Steps taken to Redesign the Visualization

The first step i followed was to have a Claim that i wanted for my visualization. 
# Claim 
Whats the best job for women in United States

The best job for a women according to my analysis would be where they get equal pay or close to the men's pay. That could also be seen in the visualization above that i am redesigning but it was very unclear which occupation gets an equal pay. 

So to start with the first thing after Data Wrangling was to upload the data in tableau, and then i created a visualization that had the salary for men and women for each occupation under each category. 

<img width="1265" alt="prototype 1" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32226800/32390276-08052c5a-c08b-11e7-81a7-5d931d9a25a1.png">

This was my intermediate version where i created a list for the job category from that you choose which category you want you get a list of all the occupations under those category on the right side. For each job category and each occupation you get a salary of men and women under that. But this didnt support my claim of which is the best salary for women , more pay is always not the best job you want to do. For example you earn a lot as an actor but everyone doesnt want to be an actor. So i editied my visualization which says the best job for women would be where they get equal pay or close to men's salary. 

So after this i calculated the ratio(women salary/men salary) and made a visualization of it. 

Visualization of Ratios for each category:

# Senior Mangers & Executives:

Above all the visualizations are the ratios of the salary and from this i can make my analysis the values for the occupations that are close to 1.0 are good jobs for women. 

# Warrant 
The warrant basically is the background of knowledge you have while making the analysis. As there is hardly one or two jobs that actually have the equal pay but the jobs that are close to ratio 1 are also good jobs for them. As i found a paper reading online:  " http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/04/03/gender-pay-gap-facts/ " 
This reading explains the fact that why still there exists a pay gap between men and women. According to it women dont end up getting the same salary is also because they often take a career break of 12-24 months because of which they end up having litlle less salary then men. 

# Final Visualization

# Future Enhancements 

The analysis was made on the salary, pay gap of men and women. But the analysis for a good job for women can not only depend on this but a lot other factors like travel time, duration of work and many more. I would like to analyze it more on the basis of other factors as well.
