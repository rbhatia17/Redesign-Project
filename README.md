# Introduction
Visualizations help you in understanding the data and making some analysis out of the given data set. The visualization i am taking to redesign is Gender Pay gap in United states.

# Visualization choosed to Redesign:

This is a pretty good visualization where we can see colorful circles a solid black line which marks the line for the equal pay for men and women. But this is a more work for a reader to do where he has to see the color of the circle go up look for which is the job field it is talking about. The second one is that soem circle's are overlapping each other not leading to a correct analysis.


# Steps taken to Redesign the Visualization

The first step i followed was to have a Claim that i wanted for my visualization. 
# Claim: Whats the best job for women in United States

The best job for a women according to my analysis would be where they get equal pay or close to the men's pay. That could also be seen in the visualization above that i am redesigning but it was very unclear which occupation gets an equal pay. 

So to start with the first thing after Data Wrangling was to upload the data in tableau, and then i created a visualization that had the salary for men and women for each occupation under each category.

This was my intermediate version where i created a list for the job category from that you choose which category you want you get a list of all the occupations under those category on the right side. For each job category and each occupation you get a salary of men and women under that. But this didnt support my claim of which is the best salary for women , more pay is always not the best job you want to do. For example you earn a lot as an actor but everyone doesnt want to be an actor. So i editied my visualization which says the best job for women would be where they get equal pay or close to men's salary. 

So after this i calculated the ratio(women salary/men salary) and made a visualization of it.
